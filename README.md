Sem Eval Task 2 (Preding Variation in Emotional Valence and Arousal over Time from Ecological essays)

motions are a fundamental aspect of human expression. The widely used affective circumplex model proposes that all emotions can be described as points in a two‑dimensional space defined by valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) (Figure 2). Affect assessment benefits many applications, such as assessing customer satisfaction, well‑being, and mental health. Most prior NLP work on affect has focused on social‑media datasets whose momentary affect is judged by annotators. However, by their very nature, emotions are subjective and change over time; they are best described by the person experiencing them in their natural environment, not by annotators perceiving affect from social‑media posts. To the best of our knowledge, no publicly available datasets account for these characteristics.

This shared task aims to reduce this gap by introducing a longitudinal dataset (Figure 1) (“ecological essays and feeling words”) collected over multiple years (2021 – 2024) consisting of real‑time essays and feeling words ((e.g., happy, calm, sad, etc.) written by U.S. service‑industry workers about “how they are feeling.” More statistics on the data can be found in the

tab. The essays and feeling words represent ecologically embedded affect—allowing the study of emotions in their natural environment—and are associated with self‑reported affect over the circumplex (Figure 2). This enables us to analyze changes in affect over shorter timespans and situations (e.g., different days and different times of the day) as well as over longer periods (e.g., across years).

The data in this task consist of chronological texts (essays and feeling words) written by various people. Each text is associated with self‑reported valence (V) (0 – 4, highly negative to highly positive affect) and arousal (A) (0 – 2, low to high energy) scores.

Importance and Impact
This task represents a shift toward modeling emotion as a lived, dynamic experience rather than an annotated perception of expressed emotion or a single static snapshot. Unlike social media datasets, which often must rely on performative or the "perceived" affect as annotated by third parties, the longitudinal ecological essays and feeling words offer introspective, self-reported data grounded in natural, real-world settings. This allows for the development of models that not only generalize across individuals but also adapt to the emotional rhythms of a single person over time, crucial for building tools that are emotionally intelligent and personalized. The data's temporal depth and free-text format provide a rare opportunity to uncover how subtle verbal behavioral cues track with self-identified internal affective states, enabling research into affective trajectories, tipping points, and resilience. By modeling how emotions unfold and are conveyed in self-described experience — rather than merely how they are perceived by outside parties, we open the door to next-generation affective systems that can proactively support mental health, augment therapeutic processes and interventions, and bridge into smarter, ambient, emotion-aware technologies.

The NLP community has huge collections of datasets labeled with "sentiment" (e.g., how people like a given movie or product, based on the number of stars they give it), but a dearth of datasets that are labeled with actual first-person affective experience. Studying such data will allow the community to understand the similarity and difference between first-party experiences and third-party annotations. Being able to assess affect, longitudinally, can also offer a step towards assessment tools for personalized mental health care, and will eventually allow better connection to objective behaviors.
